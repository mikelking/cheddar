# dummy
A dummy repo for experimenting with composer

- So the purpose of this test is to build a working composer driven build of WordPress and related plugins. I hope to define a site by plugins and git libraries in composer and have a site completely assembled via a composer update type command.

- At this point I have it building the wordpress tree and have setup the iggie file to ignore ALL of WordPress core.

- Updated to install the mu-plugins
